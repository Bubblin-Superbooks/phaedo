Whence, as I was saying, one of two alternatives follows:&mdash;either we had this knowledge at birth, and continued to know through life; or, after birth, those who are said to learn only remember, and learning is simply recollection.</p><p>Yes, that is quite true, Socrates.</p><p>And which alternative, Simmias, do you prefer? Had we the knowledge at our birth, or did we recollect the things which we knew previously to our birth?</p></div> </div>
