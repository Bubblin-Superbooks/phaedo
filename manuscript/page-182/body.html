<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Yes, my friend, but if so, when do we lose them? for they are not in us when we are born&mdash;that is admitted. Do we lose them at the moment of receiving them, or if not at what other time?</p><p>No, Socrates, I perceive that I was unconsciously talking nonsense.</p><p>Then may we not say, Simmias, that if, as we are always repeating, there is an absolute beauty, and goodness, and an absolute essence of all things; and if to this, which is now discovered to have existed in our former state, we refer all our sensations, and with this compare them, finding these ideas to be pre-existent and our inborn possession&mdash;then our souls must have had a prior existence, but if not, there would be no force in the argument? There is the same proof that these ideas must have existed before we were born, as that our souls existed before we were born; and if not the ideas, then not the souls.</p></div> </div>
