<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Very true.</p><p>And is not this the state in which the soul is most enthralled by the body?</p><p>How so?</p><p>Why, because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the soul to the body, until she becomes like the body, and believes that to be true which the body affirms to be true; and from agreeing with the body and having the same delights she is obliged to have the same habits and haunts, and is not likely ever to be pure at her departure to the world below, but is always infected by the body; and so she sinks into another body and there germinates and grows, and has therefore no part in the communion of the divine and pure and simple.</p></div> </div>
