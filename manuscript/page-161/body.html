<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Death, he answered.</p><p>And these, if they are opposites, are generated the one from the other, and have there their two intermediate processes also?</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Now, said Socrates, I will analyze one of the two pairs of opposites which I have mentioned to you, and also its intermediate processes, and you shall analyze the other to me. One of them I term sleep, the other waking. The state of sleep is opposed to the state of waking, and out of sleeping waking is generated, and out of waking, sleeping; and the process of generation is in the one case falling asleep, and in the other waking up. Do you agree?</p></div> </div>
