<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now my objection is not the same as that of Simmias; for I am not disposed to deny that the soul is stronger and more lasting than the body, being of opinion that in all such respects the soul very far excels the body. Well, then, says the argument to me, why do you remain unconvinced?&mdash;When you see that the weaker continues in existence after the man is dead, will you not admit that the more lasting must also survive during the same period of time? Now I will ask you to consider whether the objection, which, like Simmias, I will express in a figure, is of any weight. The analogy which I will adduce is that of an old weaver, who dies, and after his death somebody says:&mdash;He is not dead, he must be alive;&mdash;see, there is the coat which he himself wove and wore, and which remains whole and undecayed.</p></div> </div>
