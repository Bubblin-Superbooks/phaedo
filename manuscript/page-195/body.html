Can this, my dear Cebes, be denied?</p><p>It cannot.</p><p>But if it be true, then is not the body liable to speedy dissolution? and is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?</p><p>Certainly.</p><p>And do you further observe, that after a man is dead, the body, or visible part of him, which is lying in the visible world, and is called a corpse, and would naturally be dissolved and decomposed and dissipated, is not dissolved or decomposed at once, but may remain for a for some time, nay even for a long time, if the constitution be sound at the time of death, and the season of the year favourable?</p></div> </div>
