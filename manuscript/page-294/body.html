<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Of that upper earth which is under the heaven, I can tell you a charming tale, Simmias, which is well worth hearing.</p><p>And we, Socrates, replied Simmias, shall be charmed to listen to you.</p><p>The tale, my friend, he said, is as follows:&mdash;In the first place, the earth, when looked at from above, is in appearance streaked like one of those balls which have leather coverings in twelve pieces, and is decked with various colours, of which the colours used by painters on earth are in a manner samples. But there the whole earth is made up of them, and they are brighter far and clearer than ours; there is a purple of wonderful lustre, also the radiance of gold, and the white which is in the earth is whiter than any chalk or snow.</p></div> </div>
