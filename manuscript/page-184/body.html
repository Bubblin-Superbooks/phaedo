<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I cannot get rid of the feeling of the many to which Cebes was referring&mdash;the feeling that when the man dies the soul will be dispersed, and that this may be the extinction of her. For admitting that she may have been born elsewhere, and framed out of other elements, and was in existence before entering the human body, why after having entered in and gone out again may she not herself be destroyed and come to an end?</p><p>Very true, Simmias, said Cebes; about half of what was required has been proven; to wit, that our souls existed before we were born:&mdash;that the soul will exist after death as well as before birth is the other half of which the proof is still wanting, and has to be supplied; when that is given the demonstration will be complete.</p></div> </div>
