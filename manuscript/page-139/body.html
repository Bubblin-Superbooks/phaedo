<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Quite true.</p><p>In matters of this sort philosophers, above all other men, may be observed in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the communion of the body.</p><p>Very true.</p><p>Whereas, Simmias, the rest of the world are of opinion that to him who has no sense of pleasure and no part in bodily pleasure, life is not worth having; and that he who is indifferent about them is as good as dead.</p><p>That is also true.</p><p>What again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledge?&mdash;is the body, if invited to share in the enquiry, a hinderer or a helper? I mean to say, have sight and hearing any truth in them? Are they not, as the poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses? and yet, if even they are inaccurate and indistinct, what is to be said of the other senses?&mdash;for you will allow that they are the best of them?</p></div> </div>
