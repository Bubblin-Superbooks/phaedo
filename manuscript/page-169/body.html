<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What do you mean?</p><p>I mean what I may illustrate by the following instance:&mdash;The knowledge of a lyre is not the same as the knowledge of a man?</p><p>True.</p><p>And yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a lyre, or a garment, or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit of using? Do not they, from knowing the lyre, form in the mind's eye an image of the youth to whom the lyre belongs? And this is recollection. In like manner any one who sees Simmias may remember Cebes; and there are endless examples of the same thing.</p></div> </div>
