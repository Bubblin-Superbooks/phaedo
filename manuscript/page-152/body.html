<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Very true.</p><p>And are not the temperate exactly in the same case? They are temperate because they are intemperate&mdash;which might seem to be a contradiction, but is nevertheless the sort of thing which happens with this foolish temperance. For there are pleasures which they are afraid of losing; and in their desire to keep them, they abstain from some pleasures, because they are overcome by others; and although to be conquered by pleasure is called by men intemperance, to them the conquest of pleasure consists in being conquered by pleasure. And that is what I mean by saying that, in a sense, they are made temperate through intemperance.</p><p>Such appears to be the case.</p></div> </div>
