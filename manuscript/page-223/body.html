He stroked my head, and pressed the hair upon my neck&mdash;he had a way of playing with my hair; and then he said: To-morrow, Phaedo, I suppose that these fair locks of yours will be severed.</p><p>Yes, Socrates, I suppose that they will, I replied.</p><p>Not so, if you will take my advice.</p><p>What shall I do with them? I said.</p><p>To-day, he replied, and not to-morrow, if this argument dies and we cannot bring it to life again, you and I will both shave our locks; and if I were you, and the argument got away from me, and I could not hold my ground against Simmias and Cebes, I would myself take an oath, like the Argives, not to wear hair any more until I had renewed the conflict and defeated them.</p></div> </div>
