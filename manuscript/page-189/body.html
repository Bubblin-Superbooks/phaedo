May they not rather be described as almost always changing and hardly ever the same, either with themselves or with one another?</p><p>The latter, replied Cebes; they are always in a state of change.</p><p>And these you can touch and see and perceive with the senses, but the unchanging things you can only perceive with the mind&mdash;they are invisible and are not seen?</p></div> </div>
