<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>That is true.</p><p>And, as I was saying at first, there would be a ridiculous contradiction in men studying to live as nearly as they can in a state of death, and yet repining when it comes upon them.</p><p>Clearly.</p><p>And the true philosophers, Simmias, are always occupied in the practice of dying, wherefore also to them least of all men is death terrible. Look at the matter thus:&mdash;if they have been in every way the enemies of the body, and are wanting to be alone with the soul, when this desire of theirs is granted, how inconsistent would they be if they trembled and repined, instead of rejoicing at their departure to that place where, when they arrive, they hope to gain that which in life they desired&mdash;and this was wisdom&mdash;and at the same time to be rid of the company of their enemy.</p></div> </div>
