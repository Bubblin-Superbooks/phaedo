Well, (1) according to one explanation, because man is a prisoner, who must not open the door of his prison and run away&mdash;this is the truth in a 'mystery.' Or (2) rather, because he is not his own property, but a possession of the gods, and has no right to make away with that which does not belong to him. But why, asks Cebes, if he is a possession of the gods, should he wish to die and leave them? For he is under their protection; and surely he cannot take better care of himself than they take of him.</p></div> </div>
