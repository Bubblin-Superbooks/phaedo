<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Most true, Socrates, answered Cebes.</p><p>And this, Cebes, is the reason why the true lovers of knowledge are temperate and brave; and not for the reason which the world gives.</p><p>Certainly not.</p><p>Certainly not! The soul of a philosopher will reason in quite another way; she will not ask philosophy to release her in order that when released she may deliver herself up again to the thraldom of pleasures and pains, doing a work only to be undone again, weaving instead of unweaving her Penelope's web. But she will calm passion, and follow reason, and dwell in the contemplation of her, beholding the true and divine (which is not matter of opinion), and thence deriving nourishment. Thus she seeks to live while she lives, and after death she hopes to go to her own kindred and to that which is like her, and to be freed from human ills.</p></div> </div>
