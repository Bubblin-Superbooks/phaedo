Socrates, Apollodorus, Simmias, Cebes, Crito and an Attendant of the Prison.</p><p>SCENE: The Prison of Socrates.</p><p>PLACE OF THE NARRATION: Phlius.</p><p>ECHECRATES: Were you yourself, Phaedo, in the prison with Socrates on the day when he drank the poison?</p><p>PHAEDO: Yes, Echecrates, I was.</p><p>ECHECRATES: I should so like to hear about his death. What did he say in his last hours? We were informed that he died by taking poison, but no one knew anything more; for no Phliasian ever goes to Athens now, and it is a long time since any stranger from Athens has found his way hither; so that we had no clear account.</p></div> </div>
